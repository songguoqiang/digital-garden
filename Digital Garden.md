# What
The idea comes from [this post](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/) by Tom Critchlow. 

On the surface, a digital garden could be just a personal wiki, but the garden metaphor gives us a different perspective: it's a place where you grow your knowledge.

The garden metaphor is particularly apt. In real world gardening, you plant seeds, grow trees and harvest the fruits. In a digital garden, you cultivate your curiosity (the seeds), grow your knowledge (the trees), and produce new thoughts (the fruits).

# Why

## Challenges of knowledge workers
- "I read a book last month but I cannot remember anything about it now"
- "I saw this before, I need it now but I don't remember where I saw it"
- "I collected a lot of notes from my readings but I don't feel I am more knowledgable"

## What are the benefits of keeping a digital garden?
- It's an effective way for [[Personal Knowledge Mangagement]]
	- You have better understanding on what you learn 
	- You remember what you learn
	- You can easily recall any piece of information when you need them
	- You get new ideas for blogs/books while you tend your garden. 
- Writing is a tool for thinking, it is a way of expressing our thoughts to ourselves
- If you make it public, other people benefit from what you have learnt, or you can [collect fees for other people to visit your garden](https://www.nateliason.com/brain)
