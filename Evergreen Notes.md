# Definition
[Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) is coined by [[Andy Matuschak]]. They are the notes written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. In contrast, there are also [Transient Notes] which serves different purpose. Eventually, you need to convert the Transient Notes into Evergreen Notes so that they don't become a dump of unrelated information.

# Best Practices

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

- [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1). It’s best to create notes which are only about one thing—but which, as much as possible, capture the entirety of that thing. This way, it’s easier to form connections across topics and contexts.
- [Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF). If you read a book/article with many concepts, you'd better write a note for each concept, instead of writing a note for the whole book/article. In that way, the same concept across different sources can be inter-linked.
- [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC). 
	- Benefits:
		- The links between information helps us to undertsand them better, and remember them well.
		- The links helps to generate new ideas. You may get inspirations when you view the relationship between the concepts. e.g. [[Notion]] is a tool for [[Personal Knowledge Mangagement]] and [[Building A Second Brain]] is a methodology in [[Personal Knowledge Mangagement]]. If you view the link between those concepts, then your brain would start to think "How can I build my second brain with Notion?"
- [Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z29hLZHiVt7W2uss2uMpSZquAX5T6vaeSF6Cy)
