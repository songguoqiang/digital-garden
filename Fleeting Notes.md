This is defined in the book [[How to Take Smart Notes]].

These are purely for remembering your thoughts. They can be: fleeting ideas, notes you would have written in the margin of a book, quotes you would have underlined in a book.

You can take them on a physical notebook, or digital tools like [Goolge Keep](https://keep.google.com/). [[Roam Research]]'s [Daily Notes](https://www.roamtips.com/home/daily-notes-page-roam-research#:~:text=Whenever%20you%20open%20a%20Roam,its%20own%20Daily%20Notes%20page.) is also a good place to collect your feelting notes.

[[Andy Matuschak]] calls them [Transient Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2ZAGQBHuJ2u9WrtAQHAEHcCZTtqpsGkAsrD1)
