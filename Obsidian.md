## Obsidian vs Roam

There is one major difference in the way notes are linked. Roam is essentially an outliner: every bullet-point has a unique ID and you can't link directly to it. That way you can 

	- reference specific blocks of texts (Obsidian only allows to link to headings) 
	- display the entire block in the backlinks section (Obsidian only renders a set number of words around that mention)
	
This is a useful feature. You can write a lot of one-liners in your daily notes, and then refer to each of them from other notes, as demosntrated [here](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1072/principle-of-atomicity-file-based-zettelkasten-vs-roam-research)
