Each permanent note contains one idea, explained fully, in complete sentences.

This is defined in the book [[How to Take Smart Notes]] 

A related idea is called [[Evergreen Notes]] 

Best Practices for writing Permanent Notes:
- It should be easy to link with other associated concepts, and 
- It should be written for search/reference later. For example, if you note down a new tool you just discovered and think you might need it later, then you need to note down the possible use cases so that later on you can search the tool based on the use case.
- Recontexutalize ideas in your thought. Write down why you would care about an idea.
