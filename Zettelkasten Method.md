# Introduction
The Zettelkasten method is one of the most effective note-taking methods. But it's not known by many people. The word Zettelkasten means "box of cards" in German. This method was developed by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist. By using this method, he published 58 books and more than 400 articles in 30 years.

# What problem does it solve?
We read a lot of text in our lifetimes. Not only books, but increasingly we read online — be it magazines / newsletters / publications /twitter threads/ Facebook posts /long medium articles by the people that matter to us and give us inspiration. But the more we read, the more it seems to slip through our long term memory.

So: How to preserve this knowledge? or even better: How do you store that amount of knowledge in a way that you can access it any point in time?

# Longer Descriptions

The book [[How to Take Smart Notes]] explains this method very well.
